  computer vision for artists.



This guides the developer through the process of the entire build. It
doesn't deal with constructing a proper release distro (yet)

mac:
 PREREQUISITES:
  metrowerks code warrior to build the director xtra.
  /usr/local/PortVideoSDL-0.3 - get it from:
  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/portvideo/PortVideoSDL-0.3.src.zip
  xdk (macromedia Xtra API)
 MAKING ALL:
	build ezcam by doing `make` in the directory
	build source dir for jni by doing `make` in the directory
        build Xtra by opening up the project in mac_xtra_proj and hitting "build"



win:
 PREREQUISITES:
  visual studio
  jdk
  xdk (macromedia Xtra API)
  /usr/local/PortVideoSDL-0.3 - get it from:
    http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/portvideo/PortVideoSDL-0.3.src.zip
 MAKING ALL:
	build ezcam by doing a `make` in that directory.
	build win_jni_proj by opening sln in VS and compiling.
	build win_xtra_proj same way you built win_jni_proj




DISTRO:
	make sure the version is properly incremented.
	compile the Xtra on PC and Mac, and substitute into the proper places - using pre-existing distro as a reference.
	compile java (Mac will make the Jar) You need to update the DLL and the jnilib for mac and PC. substitute into a pre-existing distro zip.
	ZIP THEM ON A PC to avoid .DS_Store files.
	zip up the mac Xtra because it has a resource fork in it.
	upload to shell.sourceforge.net
	fill out the CHANGES.txt
	submit to the SVN
	do a release on sourceforge
	change website's download links
	do a news release if it's that important.
	if it's even more important, email the webcamxtra-development email listserv.
